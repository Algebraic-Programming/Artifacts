This directory contains the results obtained in our experiments, in the .csv output format of our scheduling tool. For each given scheduling problem (combination of input DAG and machine parameters), the file has a separate entry, listing the name of the problem, then the cost of the schedule found by each of the algorithms used (with 3 entries in each line: first the name of the algorithm, then the cost, then the number of supersteps used), and finally, the lower bound on the cost output by the ILPfull solver, if any.

The separate files in the directory correspond to our experiments with and without NUMA effects, our preliminary experiments on the huge dataset (with/without NUMA), the experiments studying the effect of latency, the training experiments to analyze the performance of initializers, the results from HDagg, and the results obtained from the multilevel approach with coarsification factors 15% and 30%. The different result files sometimes cover different datasets and parameter options.

A simple C++ script is attached in "reader.cpp" that can be used to read the result files and compute the mean ratios shown in the paper. Note that this script is only designed to demonstrate how we obtained the improvement ratios in the paper, but it is not equipped with any user interface: the different subcases and files can be processed by uncommenting the appropriate lines in the script.
