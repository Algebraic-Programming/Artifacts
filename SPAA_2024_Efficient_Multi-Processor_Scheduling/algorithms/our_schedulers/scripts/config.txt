%File = ../instances/File = ../instances/instance_CG_N4_K2_nzP0d5_p4_g1_l5.txt

%%% "Dir" mode: runs the algorithms on all files in a given directory
Dir = ../instances

%%% "Combine" mode: combines the DAG and machine description files from two directories
%Combine = ../merge1 ../merge2


%%% "TimeLimit" parameter: sets the time limit (in minutes) for the HC+HCcs and ILPcs algorithms 
TimeLimit = 2
